ABOUT THE GAME

Cards Against Humanities is a phrasal template word game,
where one player prompts other players for a list of words
to substitute blanks in a question or phrase before reading
out the completed phrase or question aloud. In this program,
after seeing the selected sentence, the user must choose
between 3 cards to complete the phrase.

the code, you're more than welcome to contribute! Thank you!
